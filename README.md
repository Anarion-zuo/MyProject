# ‘My’ Projects

This is a repository containing all of my demo projects as a CS student. Although none of the project is actually complete (only working on the ‘[cppWheels](./cppWheels)’, it is expected to be a complete one in the “near”future, including implementations of a web server, a science computation library, an operating system, and maybe more.

The directories in the current repository are *mostly* holding junks, incomplete projects or abandoned ones. The only valuable files are contained [here](./cppWheels/network), which is an incomplete web server that I have been working on.

## Web Server

A server in C++ [here](./cppWheels/network).
